Porting Richard Jones' FORTH to ARM
===================================

I need to learn ARM assembly in a hurry, and I figured porting a FORTH might
be a decent way to do that. I came across Richard Jones' wonderful FORTH and
that's what I settled on:

There seem to be ports to both PowerPC and Motorola 68k already, but no ARM
port that I could find:
