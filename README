Porting Richard Jones' FORTH to ARM
===================================

I need to learn ARM assembly in a hurry, and I figured porting a FORTH might
be a decent way to do that. I came across Richard Jones' wonderful FORTH and
that's what I settled on:

There seem to be ports to both PowerPC and Motorola 68k already, but no ARM
port that I could find:

I've checked all of these into git for my own reference, but the only thing
that's actually "mine" is the ARM version. I'll decide on a license at some
point too. :-D

Update: I found two more clones of Richard Jones' FORTH, here are the links
just for completeness:
